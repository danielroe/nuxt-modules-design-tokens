**@nuxtjs/design-tokens** offers a straightforward way to use Design Tokens definition inside your Nuxt app. 

It is powered by [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary), a powerful library by Amazon.

Users can define a set of Design Tokens as they would define a set of configurations options for their app.

Then, these tokens get processed by Style Dictionary on each file save, and gets injected into your Nuxt app.

This allows global usage of tokens anywhere in the app, even in external files like `tailwind.config`...
